      <li>
        He was a <strong>Hungarian-American mathematician</strong>, <strong>aerospace engineer</strong>, and <strong>physicist</strong> who was active primarily in the fields of <strong>aeronautics and astronautics</strong>. He was responsible for many key advances in aerodynamics, notably on <strong>supersonic and hypersonic airflow characterization</strong>. He is regarded as the outstanding <strong>aerodynamic theoretician</strong> of the <strong>20th century</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        He studied engineering at the city's <em>Royal Joseph Technical University</em>, known today as <strong>Budapest University of Technology and Economics</strong>. After graduating in <time datetime="1902">1902</time> he moved to the German Empire and joined <strong>Ludwig Prandtl</strong> at the <strong>University of Göttingen</strong>, where he received his <em>doctorate</em> in <time datetime="1908">1908</time>.

      <li>
        In <time datetime="1912">1912</time> he accepted a position as director of the <strong>Aeronautical Institute at RWTH Aachen University</strong>, a leading German university. His time at <strong>RWTH Aachen</strong> was interrupted by service in the <em>Austro-Hungarian Army</em> from <time datetime="1915">1915</time> to <time datetime="1918">1918</time>, when he designed the <strong>Petróczy-Kármán-Žurovec</strong>, an <em>early helicopter</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        In <time datetime="1930">1930</time> Kármán accepted the directorship of the <strong>Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology (<em>GALCIT</em>)</strong>. 
      </li>
      <li>
        In <time datetime="1936">1936</time>, Kármán engaged the legal services of <strong>Andrew G. Haley</strong> to form the <em>Aerojet Corporation</em>, with his graduate student <strong>Frank Malina</strong> and their experimental rocketry collaborator <strong>Jack Parsons</strong>, to manufacture <em>JATO rocket motors</em>. He later became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

      <li>
        In <time datetime="1944">1944</time> he and others affiliated with GALCIT founded the <strong>Jet Propulsion Laboratory (<em>JPL</em>)</strong>, which is now a Federally funded research and development center managed and operated by <strong>Caltech</strong> under a contract from <strong>NASA</strong>. In <time datetime="1946">1946</time> he became the first chairman of the <em>Scientific Advisory Group</em> which studied aeronautical technologies for the United States Army Air Forces. He also helped found <strong>AGARD</strong>, the <strong>NATO aerodynamics research oversight group</strong> (<time datetime="1951">1951</time>), the <strong>International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences</strong> (<time datetime="1956">1956</time>), the <strong>International Academy of Astronautics</strong> (<time datetime="1960">1960</time>), and the <strong>Von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics in Sint-Genesius-Rode</strong>, south of Brussels (<time datetime="1956">1956</time>).
